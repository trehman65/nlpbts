 Kindergarten supplies
 2016-2017 Schaal Year
BACKPACK
Each child needs a backpack that can accommodate a 9" x 12" folder and books
Backpacks need to be clearly labeled with your child's name. Many backpacks look alike, so this is very important.
Your child is expected to bring the backpack to and from school every day.
No wheels, please!
