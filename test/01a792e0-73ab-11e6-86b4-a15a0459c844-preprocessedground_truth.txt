7/8 Supply List 2016/17
This is an advance list of supplies that you will need to purchase for 7th or 8th grade. It is not necessary to bring these in on Orientation Day or the first day or school, but you should bring some paper and something to write with. Teachers will let you know then what materials you should have each day and what should be kept at home.
Students will receive an agenda book in which to write their daily assignments. Assignments are also available on the
school network (Haiku), but we encourage daily use of the agenda book. The agenda book is an important organizational tool, and the Haiku page should be considered only a backup.
You will also need a Sidwell Friends uniform for PE, purchased through The Fox Den. For cooler weather, plan to keep a
sweatshirt and sweatpants in your gym locker, but these do not have to be Sidwell Friends School items. You will also
need a combination lock for your gym locker. Please label all supplies, including every piece of clothing, especially gym
clothes. Coaches will give out requirements for specific sports once each season begins.
Lockers on the 7/8 hall have built-in combination locks. Students will be required to unpack their backpacks each day and may not carry them to classes.
Laptops will be issued to all 7th and 8th graders. We ask that students have a flashdrive (minimum of 8 gb) on a lanyard
for projects and papers and a pair of earbuds or earphones to use with their laptop for work in the classroom, the
library, and in aftercare.
In addition, every student needs some kind of organization system. Most students prefer zip up binders for ease of use.
One of the following systems is recommended.
1) Single binder (zip up preferred) with dividers and folders color -coded for each subject.
 OR
2) Five 1/2" binders , one for each academic subject area, each with loose leaf paper.
General supplies:
generous supply of loose leaf lined paper
pencils, colored pencils, pens and a zip up utensil holder for binder.
Scientific (not graphing) calculator
Math: Notebook-sized graph paper, preferably 3-hole punched. Eighth graders may find it convenient to use a bound notebook or pad of graph paper, rather than looseleaf.
Available at home: protractor, colored pencils, ruler with both metric and standard measures. The math department will be purchasing compasses for student use.
Social Studies: Team Sea students (7th and 8th) need a 100-page spiral notebook or a section of their binder for their reading and class notes.
Latin: Students will need a set of colored pencils, five dividers in their Latin binder section, and 4x6 index cards.
Chinese: Students will need a set of colored pencils (8) and a sketch book. This should be 8 1/2 x 11" or 9 x 12", containing
20-25 pages of art paper that may be torn out.
We encourage you to consider the planet when you are purchasing school supplies) Close the loop - buy recycled paper products and pencils that are made with a responsible use of wood.
