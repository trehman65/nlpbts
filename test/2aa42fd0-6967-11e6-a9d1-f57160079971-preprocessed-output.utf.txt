1 of 2 Grade Sumly List for 2016/2017 Paae 1 of 2 
In Second grade this year we are determined to win the 
pencil war! We are tired of pencil leads in the floor, 
chewed up pencils and erasers and children never having 
sharpened pencils! So we will provide your child with 
pencils and erasers. We realize this will be quite an 
expense and would love for parents to donate to this fund 
if you are able. A few dollars would help a lot! We will 
only use Ticonderoga pencils in our class. The reason for 
this is Ticonderoga pencils last longer, sharpen better 
(easy on the electric pencil sharpener) and write better. 
You are more than welcome to buy this type of pencil and 
send those in. Please do not send any other pencils in. 
We realize we sound very picky, but we have done this 
for the last 2 years and it really has been a huge 
success!!
